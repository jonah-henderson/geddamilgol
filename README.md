# Geddamilgol

Geddamilgol is a quick and stupid incremental game built on Vue. 
Your one objective: get a million gold.

The project is built on Vue and aims to be as data-driven as possible. All the actions,
items, resources, and upgrades are loaded from data files. In fact, with just a little 
adjusting, Geddamilgol would probably work as a basic, but serviceable, 
incremental game engine.

## Building

Run `npm run build` to output the bundled content to a `dist` folder.

## Serving

After a build, `dist` can be served by any HTTP server, e.g. `python3 -m http.server`. Or, run the development server with
`npm run serve`.

## Known issues

The styles need a complete rework...

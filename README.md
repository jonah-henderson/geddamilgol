# Geddamilgol

Geddamilgol is a quick and stupid incremental game built on Vue. 
Your one objective: get a million gold.

The project is built on Vue and aims to be as data-driven as possible. All the actions,
items, resources, and upgrades are loaded from data files. In fact, with just a little 
adjusting, Geddamilgol would probably work as a basic, but serviceable, 
incremental game engine.

## Known issues

The styles need a complete rework...
